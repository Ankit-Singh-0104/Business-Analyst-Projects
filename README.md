💼 PayPredict AI: Intelligent B2B Invoice Payment Forecasting & Management System
🧾 Introduction
In the B2B (Business-to-Business) world, companies operate on credit, where goods or services are delivered and invoices are raised with a set payment due date. These unpaid invoices fall under Accounts Receivable (AR). While due dates are defined, payments are often delayed, affecting the company’s cash flow and operations.
To address this challenge, PayPredict AI combines Machine Learning and Full Stack Development to build an intelligent invoice management system that predicts payment delays and streamlines the AR process.

❓ Problem Statement
The Accounts Receivable department is responsible for:
Tracking overdue payments,
Sending reminders to clients,
Ensuring timely collection of dues,
Maintaining healthy cash flow.
Manual tracking is inefficient and reactive. The need arises for a smart system that can proactively predict when a client is likely to pay and provide tools to manage invoices efficiently.

🎯 Project Objectives
🔍 Predict the expected payment delay category of an invoice at creation.
🛠️ Develop a full-stack web application to manage, analyze, and visualize invoices.
📊 Support AR teams with actionable insights and easy-to-use tools.

🔍 Key Features
✅ AI-Based Payment Delay Prediction using a trained Random Forest Classifier.
📊 Receivables Dashboard to display and manage invoice records.

📝 CRUD Functionalities – Add, Edit, Delete invoices.
🔄 Pagination for seamless navigation of large datasets.
📈 Visual Analytics to support decision-making.

🔬 Machine Learning Workflow
1. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed missing values, outliers, and feature distributions.
Focused on invoice and payment date relationships.

2. 📈 Data Visualization
Heatmaps, histograms, and time-series plots to understand patterns.

3. 🧬 Feature Engineering
Created delay-related features.
Encoded categorical values and extracted date components.

4. 🤖 Model Development
Built a Random Forest Classifier to predict delay categories.
Optimized hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
Evaluated model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
